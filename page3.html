      <h2>HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</h2>
      <img src="media/image2.jpg" alt="Jon Duckett HTML and CSS book cover">
      <p>Every day, more and more people want to learn some HTML and CSS. Joining the professional web designers and programmers are new audiences who need to know a little bit of code at work (update a content management system or e-commerce store) and those who want to make their personal blogs more attractive. Many books teaching HTML and CSS are dry and only written for those who want to become programmers, which is why this book takes an entirely new approach.</p>

      <h2>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</h2>
      <img src="media/image4.jpg" alt="David Flanagan JavaScript guide book cover">
      <p>This book is for programmers who want to learn JavaScript and for web developers who want to take their understanding and mastery to the next level. It begins by explaining the JavaScript language itself, in detail, from the bottom up. It then builds on that foundation to cover the web platform and Node.js.</p>
